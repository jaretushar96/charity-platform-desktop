# Charity Platform ‚Äì Java Swing Desktop Application

This is a desktop-based project developed using **Java Swing**, **AWT**, **JDBC**, and **PostgreSQL**. It is made to help manage data of people who need help (beneficiaries) and display their details to unknown donors, who can support them by scanning their UPI QR codes.

## üí° Project Idea

In this application:

- A beneficiary can register by entering name, contact details, problem description, and uploading their photo and UPI QR.
- After login, the beneficiary can preview, edit, delete, or submit their information to show on the "Donate Now" section.
- The "Donate Now" page shows all verified beneficiaries. Donors don‚Äôt need to log in ‚Äî they can view and directly help.

This app is fully designed using Java Swing GUI and stores all data in PostgreSQL.
